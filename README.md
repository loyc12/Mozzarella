# Mozzarella
Mozzarella modpack for minecraft 1.18.2 (fabric)

Requires at the very least 6g of ram, tested with 10
Curently leaks alot of memory, and so the game will mostly stop responding after loading enough chunks
You can get around that by pregenerating with chunky tho
Also wtf why does the main screen take 6G
